The project that I chose to do was the Metal Detector where it uses a search coil and a circuit to see if there is any metal nearby. The circuit consists of resistors, capacitors, a transmitter, and a piezo buzzer. The search coil is made by wrapping wire around a lid to create a inductor. The ends of the wire then connect to the circuit. How the search coil works is that the inductor contains a magnetic field so, when there is metal near it, a signal will be produced. The signal then travels to the circuit which would cause the led to blink faster and the buzzer to buzz faster. The circuit also contains a null button which would allow me to recalibrate the metal detector.

# Starter Project Milestone
The Starter Project that I did was the Useless Machine. Here, I first soldered the switches, led, and resistors onto the circuit board. I also connected the wires on the motors and batteries with the circuit board.
