# Metal Detector
The Metal Detector is mainly built with three parts. A search coil, a base, and a circuit. When all of the components are combined, it makes a complete detector that buzzes whenever there is anything metal nearby. The way it works is that the inductor has a magnetic field. If there is anything metal near it, there will be a signal that will pass through the search coil which is also connected to the circuit. The circuit includes a buzzer and an led. The buzzer and led will buzz and blink rapidly when the circuit recieves the signal. That is how you would know that there is metal near the search coil. Finally, mounting both parts to the base would allow you to scan the ground while walking around which allows you to go around and find metallic object on or under the ground.

# First Milestone

The project that I chose to do was the Metal Detector where it uses a search coil and a circuit to see if there is any metal nearby. The circuit consists of resistors, capacitors, a transistor, and a piezo buzzer. The search coil is made by wrapping wire around a lid to create a inductor. The ends of the wire then connect to the circuit. How the search coil works is that the inductor contains a magnetic field so, when there is metal near it, a signal will be produced. The signal then travels to the circuit which would cause the led to blink faster and the buzzer to buzz faster. The circuit also contains a null button which would allow me to recalibrate the metal detector.

# Starter Project Milestone
The Starter Project that I did was the Useless Machine. Here, I first soldered the switches, led, and resistors onto the circuit board. I also connected the wires on the motors and batteries with the circuit board. They way the machine works is that when you flip a switch, the motor turns on moving a arm which evetnually flips the switch the other way. This causes the motor to spin the other way until the arm hits a snap switch which turns off the machine. The led also changes color according to what direction the motor is moving. When the switch is first flipped, a green color emits from the led. Once the arm rehits the switch, the led changes to a red color until the arm hit the snap switch which turn it off.
