# First Milestone

The project that I chose to do was the Metal Detector where it uses a search coil and a circuit to see if there is any metal nearby. The circuit consists of resistors, capacitors, a transmitter, and a piezo buzzer.

# Starter Project Milestone
The Starter Project that I did was the Useless Machine. Here, I first soldered the switches, led, and resistors onto the circuit board. I also connected the wires on the motors and batteries with the circuit board.
