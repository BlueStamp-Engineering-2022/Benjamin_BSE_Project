# First Milestone

The project that I chose to do was the Metal Detector where it uses a search coil and a circuit to see if there is any metal nearby. The circuit consists of resistors, capacitors, a transistor, and a piezo buzzer. The search coil is made by wrapping wire around a lid to create a inductor. The ends of the wire then connect to the circuit. How the search coil works is that the inductor contains a magnetic field so, when there is metal near it, a signal will be produced. The signal then travels to the circuit which would cause the led to blink faster and the buzzer to buzz faster. The circuit also contains a null button which would allow me to recalibrate the metal detector.

# Starter Project Milestone
The Starter Project that I did was the Useless Machine. Here, I first soldered the switches, led, and resistors onto the circuit board. I also connected the wires on the motors and batteries with the circuit board. They way the machine works is that when you flip a switch, the motor turns on moving a arm which evetnually flips the switch the other way. This causes the motor to spin the other way until the arm hits a snap switch which turns off the machine. The led also changes color according to what direction the motor is moving. When the switch is first flipped, a green color emits from the led. Once the arm rehits the switch, the led changes to a red color until the arm hit the snap switch which turn it off.
